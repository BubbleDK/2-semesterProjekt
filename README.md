## Overview

Welcome to B2B Gift Ordering System for Kop & Kande Frederikshavn. A project developed on the 2nd semester of AP in Computer Science at UCN Aalborg by Christian Funder, Emil Tolstrup Petersen, Jakob Kjeldsteen, Mark Drongesen and Rasmus Gudiksen.

This project is the development of a Proof of Concept for a B2B Gift Ordering System in collaboration with Kop & Kande Frederikshavn. The project consists of an Eclipse Windowbuilder based frontend and a Java based backend.

## Usage

This project has no actual use but lays the foundation for a proof of concept for a Gift ordering system for businesses through Kop & Kande. The idea is that a business should be able to present their employees with a selection of gifts from Kop & Kande,
for example for christmas. Business "X" will use this system to choose a selection of gift(s) for their employees to choose. These gifts are merchandise from Kop & Kande bought by Business "X" for their employees. In this case Business "X" is a customer of Kop & Kande.

Examples of GUI:

A giftcode ("gavekode" top right) has been generated for each employee attached to the order and in this case "jakob@mail.dk" is the employee selecting a gift from the selection on the left
